# SAN (Storage Area Network)-

-   A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a specialized network that provides high-speed access to shared storage resources. 

-   It is designed to connect multiple servers or computer systems to a centralized storage infrastructure, enabling them to access and share data concurrently.

-   In a SAN, the storage devices (such as disk arrays or tape libraries) are separate from the servers or computers. 

-  They are interconnected using high-speed communication technologies like Fibre Channel or iSCSI.

## Features:

1) Network resource used exclusively for the storage.
2)  SCSI protocol for end to end communication : Minimum impact for DAS to
SAN migration.
3) Access to data through logical blocks and not to file.
4) Compatibility with an high number of nodes.
5) High reliability and ability to react to failures.
6) Performance allows concurrent access of disk or tape arrays by two or more
servers at high speeds.

## Advantages:

1) SAN support large and heterogeneous block data transfer
2) It gives data transfer reliability
3) Reduces LAN traffic
4) Configuration flexibility
5) High performance
6) High scalability
7) Centralized management
8) Multiple vendor offerings
