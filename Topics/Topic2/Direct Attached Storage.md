# DAS (Direct Attached Storage)-

-   Direct Attached Storage (DAS) is a type of storage that connects directly to a computer or server using a cable. 
-   It's like plugging an external hard drive into your computer. DAS provides a dedicated storage space for that specific computer and is not shared with other devices on a network.

-   In simpler terms, DAS is an additional storage that you connect directly to your computer. It's fast, easy to set up, and keeps your data secure.
-   However, it has limited scalability, meaning it's not ideal for expanding storage across multiple computers.

## Advantages-

1) DAS is ideal for localized file sharing in environments with a single server or a few servers.

2) DAS devices can offer block-level access or file-level access.

3) Data Security: DAS provides local storage, meaning the data is physically located near the computer or server.

4) DAS can still be used locally to store less critical data.

5) Initial cost Of DAS is lower than NAS.

## Disadvantages-

1) DAS is limited in its scalability.

2) DAS is limited to dedicated servers.

3) Single Point of Failure: In DAS setups, if the computer or server fails, it can result in the loss of access to the storage and data.

4) Physical Limitations: DAS relies on physical connections, which may limit the distance between the computer and the storage device.
