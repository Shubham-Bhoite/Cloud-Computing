# Security challenges for cloud service customers :

1) Shared responsibility: Cloud providers are responsible for the security of the underlying infrastructure, but organizations are responsible for the security of their data and applications.

2) Data breaches: Cloud providers are a frequent target for data breaches. In 2021, there were over 4,500 data breaches that exposed over 15 billion records. This data can be used by attackers to commit identity theft, fraud, and other crimes.

3) Malicious insiders: Malicious insiders are employees or contractors who have access to sensitive data. They can use this access to steal data, commit fraud, or sabotage systems.

4) Malware and ransomware: Malware and ransomware are a growing threat to cloud computing. These attacks can steal data, encrypt data, or disrupt operations.

5) Account hijacking: Account hijacking is a common attack that can be used to gain access to cloud accounts. Once an attacker has access to an account, they can steal data, change permissions, or disrupt operations.
