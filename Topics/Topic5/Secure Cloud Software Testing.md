# Secure Cloud Software Testing:


-   Secure cloud software testing is the process of testing software applications in a cloud environment to ensure that they are secure. 

-  This type of testing typically includes:

1) Vulnerability scanning: This involves identifying and assessing security vulnerabilities in the application's code, configuration, and dependencies.

2) Penetration testing: This involves simulating an attack on the application to identify and exploit security vulnerabilities.

3) Security testing of cloud infrastructure: This involves testing the security of the cloud infrastructure that hosts the application, such as the cloud provider's security controls and the application's access control policies.

4) Security testing of application data: This involves testing the security of the application's data, such as its encryption and access control policies.
