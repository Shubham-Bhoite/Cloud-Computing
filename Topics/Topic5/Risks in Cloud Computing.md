# Risks in Cloud Computing:

-  Cloud security is the protection of data stored online via cloud computing platforms from theft, leakage, and deletion.
-   Methods of providing cloud security include firewalls, penetration testing, tokenization, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), and avoiding public internet connections.

## Cloud security is designed to protect the following, regardless of your responsibilities :

1) Physical networks - Routers, electrical power, cabling, climate controls.

2) Data storage - Hard drives.

3) Data servers - Core network computing hardware and software.

4) Computer virtualization frameworks - Virtual machine software,
machines, and guest machines.

5) Operating Systems (OS) - Software that houses.

6) Middleware - Application Programming Interface (API) management.

7) Runtime environments - Execution and upkeep of a running program.

8) Data - All the information stored, modified, and accessed.

9) Applications - Traditional software services (email, tax software, productivity suites, etc.)

10) End-user hardware - Computers, mobile devices, Internet Of Things (IOT)
