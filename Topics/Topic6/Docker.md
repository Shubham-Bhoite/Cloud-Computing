# Docker :


-  Docker is a tool that helps you package and run applications in isolated containers.
-   Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained, making them a great way to deploy and run applications.

-  Docker containers are isolated from each other, meaning that one container cannot affect another container. This makes them a good choice for running multiple applications on the same host. 



## Benefits of  Docker:

1) Portability: Containers are portable, meaning they can be run on any machine that has Docker installed. This makes it easy to deploy and run applications in different environments.

2) Isolation: Containers are isolated from each other, meaning that one container cannot affect another container. This helps to prevent security vulnerabilities and makes it easier to debug applications.

3) Scalability: Containers can be scaled up or down easily, making them a good choice for applications that need to be able to handle fluctuating traffic.
