# Automatic Cloud Computing:

-   Automatic cloud computing is the use of technology to perform tasks with reduced human assistance in order to unite cloud management processes. 
-   It is a broad term that refers to processes and tools that reduce or eliminate manual efforts used to provision and manage cloud computing workloads and services. 
-   Organizations can apply cloud automation to private, public and hybrid cloud environments.

## Cloud automation can be used to automate a wide range of tasks, including:

1) Resource allocation: This includes tasks such as provisioning servers, scaling up and down resources, and deprovisioning unused resources.
2) Application deployment: This includes tasks such as deploying new applications, updating existing applications, and rolling back failed deployments.
3) Infrastructure configuration: This includes tasks such as configuring firewalls, load balancers, and other network devices.
4) Security: This includes tasks such as patching systems, scanning for vulnerabilities, and enforcing security policies.
5) Monitoring: This includes tasks such as collecting performance data, identifying problems, and alerting users to potential issues.


## Cloud automation can offer a number of benefits, including:

-   Increased efficiency: By automating tasks, organizations can free up their IT staff to focus on more strategic work.
-   Reduced costs: Cloud automation can help to reduce costs by eliminating the need for manual provisioning and management of cloud resources.
-   Improved reliability: Cloud automation can help to improve the reliability of cloud environments by reducing the risk of human error.
-   Increased scalability: Cloud automation can help to improve the scalability of cloud environments by making it easier to add or remove resources as needed.
