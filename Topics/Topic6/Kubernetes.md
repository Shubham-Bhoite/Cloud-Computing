# Kubernetes :

-   Kubernetes (also known as k8s or “kube”) is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
-   Kubernetes is a powerful tool that can help you automate the management of containerized applications. It is widely used by companies of all sizes, from startups to large enterprises.

##  Features of Kubernetes:

1) Container orchestration: Kubernetes can manage the deployment and scaling of containerized applications across a cluster of hosts.

2) Service discovery: Kubernetes can automatically create and manage DNS records for services, making it easy for containers to find each other.

3) Load balancing: Kubernetes can automatically load balance traffic across a set of containers, ensuring that no single container is overloaded.

4) Health checking: Kubernetes can monitor the health of containers and automatically restart them if they fail.



##  Benefits of using Kubernetes:

1) Increased reliability: Kubernetes can help you to improve the reliability of your applications by automatically restarting containers that fail.

2) Reduced operational overhead: Kubernetes can automate many of the manual tasks involved in managing containerized applications, freeing up your team to focus on other things.

3) Improved scalability: Kubernetes can help you to scale your applications up or down easily, as demand changes.

4) Increased portability: Kubernetes can be used to deploy applications on a variety of platforms, including on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid environments.
