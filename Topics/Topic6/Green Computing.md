# Green Computing :

-   Green computing, also known as green IT or sustainable IT, is the practice of maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing environmental impact in the ways computer chips, systems and software are designed and used. 
-  The goals of green computing are similar to green chemistry: reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize energy efficiency during the product's lifetime, increase the recyclability or biodegradability of defunct products and factory waste. 
-  Green computing is important for all classes of systems, ranging from handheld systems to large-scale data centers. 

## Here are some of the key principles of green computing:

1) Energy efficiency: Green computing aims to reduce the amount of energy used by computers and other electronic devices. This can be achieved through a variety of methods, such as using energy-efficient hardware, optimizing software settings, and turning off devices when they are not in use.

2) Reduced material use: Green computing also seeks to reduce the amount of raw materials used in the manufacture of computers and other electronic devices. This can be achieved by using recycled materials, designing products that are easier to disassemble, and using materials that are less harmful to the environment.

3) Safe disposal: Green computing also takes into account the safe disposal of electronic waste. This includes recycling or refurbishing old devices, and preventing hazardous materials from entering the environment.


## There are many benefits to green computing. These include:

-  Reduced energy consumption: Green computing can help to reduce energy consumption, which can save businesses and individuals money on their energy bills. It can also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change.

-  Reduced pollution: Green computing can help to reduce pollution from the manufacturing and disposal of electronic devices. This can protect human health and the environment.

-   Increased efficiency: Green computing can help to improve the efficiency of computer systems. This can lead to faster performance and lower costs.

-  Better public image: Businesses that adopt green computing practices can improve their public image and attract new customers.
There are many ways to implement green computing in your organization.
