# Introduction to Cloud Computing:


-   Cloud computing is a way of delivering computing services over the internet. 

-   Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, businesses and individuals can use virtual resources that are hosted on remote servers, which are owned and operated by third-party providers.

-   This model allows users to access a wide range of computing resources, such as storage, processing power, and software applications, without having to invest in and manage their own hardware and infrastructure. 

-    The cloud provider handles the maintenance, upgrades, and security of the infrastructure, while the user can focus on using the services provided.

-    cloud computing provides a convenient and flexible way to access and utilize computing resources, without the need for significant upfront investment or ongoing maintenance.
