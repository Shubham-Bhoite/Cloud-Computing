Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computing resources over the internet. There are three main types of cloud service models:

1)  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This cloud service model provides users with access to virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking. Users can deploy and manage their own operating systems, applications, and software.

2)  Platform as a Service (PaaS): This cloud service model provides users with a complete development and deployment environment for their applications. Users can develop, run, and manage their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

3)  Software as a Service (SaaS): This cloud service model provides users with access to software applications over the internet. The software is hosted and managed by the cloud provider, and users can access it using a web browser or an application interface. Examples of SaaS applications include email, customer relationship management (CRM), and office productivity tools.
