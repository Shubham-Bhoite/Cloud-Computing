# Types of Virtualizations:

## 1) Server Virtualization -
-  Server virtualization involves the partitioning of a physical server into multiple virtual servers, each running its own operating system and applications. 

-  This is made possible through a software layer called a hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM). 

-  The hypervisor abstracts the underlying hardware and allocates the physical resources, such as CPU, memory and storage to the virtual servers.

### Benefits-

-  Isolation
-  Flexibility
-  Disaster Recovery

## 2) Desktop Virtualization -
-  Desktop virtualization involves creating virtual desktop environments that can be accessed remotely by end-users. 

-  Instead of running an operating system and applications on a local computer, users connect to a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) that resides on a centralized server.

### Benefits-
-  Centralized Management
-  Enhanced Security
-  Device Independence

## 3) Network Virtualization -
-  Network virtualization abstracts the physical network infrastructure and creates virtual networks that operate independently. 

-  It enables the logical segmentation of a single physical network into multiple virtual networks, each with its own addressing, policies, and services.

### Benefits-
-  Improved Scalability
-  Agility and Flexibility
-  Simplified Management

## 4) Storage Virtualization -
-  Storage virtualization combines multiple physical storage devices into a single, virtualized storage pool. 

-  It abstracts the logical storage from the physical storage infrastructure, providing flexibility and ease of management.

### Benefits-
-  Data Migration and Mobility
-  Increased Availability
-  Simplified Management

## 5) Application Virtualization -
-  Application virtualization decouples applications from the underlying operating system and encapsulates them in a virtual environment. 

-  This allows applications to run on different operating systems or configurations without conflicts.

### Benefits-
-  Mobility
-  Compatibility
-  Enhanced Security

## 6) Operating System Virtualization -
-  Operating system (OS) virtualization, also known as containerization, allows multiple instances of an operating system to run on a single physical machine.

-   Each instance, called a container, operates as an isolated environment with its own applications and libraries.

### Benefits-
-  Resource Efficiency
-  Rapid Deployment
-  Portability

## 7) Hardware Virtualization -
-  Hardware virtualization allows the creation of virtual machines (VMs) that emulate complete computer systems, including the CPU, memory, storage, and other hardware components. 

-  This type of virtualization enables running multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously on a single physical machine.

### Types==>
-  Full Virtualization: In full virtualization, the hypervisor simulates the underlying hardware, allowing unmodified guest operating systems to run on the virtual machines.

-  Para-virtualization: In para-virtualization, the guest operating systems are modified to interact with the hypervisor, resulting in better performance but requiring modifications to the guest operating system.

### Benefits-
-  Flexibility and Scalability
-  Disaster Recovery
-  Isolation
