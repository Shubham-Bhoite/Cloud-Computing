# Virtualization:

-  Virtualization refers to the creation of virtual versions or representations of computing resources, such as servers, operating systems, storage devices, or networks.

-    It enables the consolidation of multiple physical resources into a virtual environment, allowing greater efficiency, flexibility, and utilization of hardware.

-   In virtualization, a software layer called a hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) abstracts the underlying physical resources and provides a virtualization platform. 

-   This VMM enables the creation and management of multiple virtual machines (VMs) or virtual environments on a single physical host.

-   Each virtual machine operates as an independent entity, running its own operating system and applications, as if it were a separate physical computer. 

-  Multiple VMs can coexist on the same physical server, sharing its resources while remaining isolated from each other.
