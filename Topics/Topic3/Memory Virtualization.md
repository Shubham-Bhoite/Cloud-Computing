# Memory Virtualization:

-  Memory virtualization is a technique that abstracts and manages the physical memory resources of a computer system to provide a virtualized and more efficient memory environment. 

-  It allows multiple processes or virtual machines (VMs) to run concurrently while isolating them from each other.

## ==>Memory virtualization involves the following key components and techniques<==

1) Memory Address Translation:==> The virtualization layer intercepts memory accesses made by processes or VMs and translates their virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses. 

2) Memory Mapping:==> The virtualization layer maintains mappings between virtual addresses and physical addresses, allowing processes or VMs to access memory locations without knowledge of the underlying physical memory layout.

3) Memory Overcommitment:==> Memory overcommitment refers to the ability to allocate more virtual memory than physically available. It allows efficient utilization of memory resources by transparently sharing memory pages across processes or VMs. 

4) Memory Ballooning:==> Memory ballooning is a technique used in virtualized environments to adjust the memory allocation to VMs based on demand. 

5) Memory Deduplication:==> Memory deduplication is a mechanism that identifies and eliminates duplicate memory pages across processes or VMs. 

## Benefits:
-  Resource Optimization
-  Isolation
-  Flexibility and Scalability
