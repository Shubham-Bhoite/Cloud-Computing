# Virtualization Application:

-   Packaging: The application and its required components, such as libraries, configuration files, and dependencies, are packaged together into a single executable file or container. This package contains everything needed to run the application.

-   Isolation: The virtualization technology creates an isolated runtime environment for the application, ensuring that it runs independently and does not interfere with other applications or the underlying operating system.

-  Dependency Management: Application virtualization handles dependencies by including the necessary components within the package or utilizing shared components already present on the host system. This eliminates conflicts between different application versions or dependencies.

-  Sandbox Environment: The virtualized application runs within a sandboxed environment, which provides security by isolating it from the host system. This prevents potential security vulnerabilities or conflicts caused by the application.

-   Portable Execution: Since the application package contains all the necessary components, it can be executed on different systems or configurations without requiring specific installation procedures or modifications to the host operating system.
