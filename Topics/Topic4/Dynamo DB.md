# Dynamo DB

-   DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

-  It is designed for applications that require low-latency, high-performance access to large amounts of data. 

-  DynamoDB is a fully managed service, meaning AWS takes care of the underlying infrastructure, scalability, and availability, allowing developers to focus on building their applications.

##  features :
1) NoSQL Database Model ==> DynamoDB follows a NoSQL (non-relational) database model, which means it does not use traditional tables with fixed schemas like in relational databases.

2) Key-Value Store ==> DynamoDB is often described as a key-value store. Each item in the database is identified by a primary key, which can be either a simple key  or a composite key .

3) Scalability and Performance ==> DynamoDB is designed to scale horizontally and can handle high traffic and large datasets.

4) Serverless and Pay-Per-Use ==> DynamoDB supports a serverless model, where developers don't have to worry about provisioning and managing servers. AWS handles all the infrastructure scaling and maintenance. 

5) High Availability and Durability ==> DynamoDB replicates data across multiple Availability Zones within a region to ensure high availability and durability.

6) Flexible Data Model ==> DynamoDB supports various data types, including strings, numbers, binary data, sets, lists, and maps.
